# papers
List of papers I have read, am reading and want to read starting 1st Sept 2017.

## Read
- A3C - [Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf) - ICML 2016 [RL]
  - Instead of training on samples from replay memory to decorrelate temporal relations, use multiple agents operating in their own copy the environment using a current global policy. Training becomes more stable. Beats the previous best in half the training time. Train k agents on a single k-core CPU. No communication costs as with [Gorrila](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04296). In case of off-policy learning the individual agents can apply different policies which is more explorative and stable.
